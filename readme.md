# Why bust out another thousand?

Use your mind, prevent a catastrophe. If you like the water, just keep in mind it don't mix well with metal. No amount of grease scheduling will beat it. In the end water wins. Know the signs of age and make the preventative maintenance schedule and save the "G" for something else- like the parts to build you an underwater rover with... well that may be a credit card purchase, but who's counting here- we're talking white collar sports. 

We have a couple trailers, a couple engines (One 2 stroke 200 Series Mercury, One BF90A Honda 4-stroke) a couple fiberglass boats, and not so cheap gear to catch a monster with here. Oh- and a bimini top to sew, but don't tell any of your poor friends we know how to sew (or know how to fix broken sewing machines) or you will have 50 pairs of pants, three machines and only one works, sitting next to your bed in a week- I promise you that.

## Tools:
* One good brain
* A few bad mishaps- hopefully not swimming like Sean did.
* Backlog to write your thoughts in and a "schedule" to abide by.

## We will let the pictures speak for themselves

Keeping the blue collar part in the front of the topic here. Let's start with not being on the lake. We have to get the boat there *first* in one piece. So good transportation here starts with the *driver*, the *vehicle* and *trailer*, and last *the boat*. Just remember we can't fix *stupid*, and I have been oooooohhhhh sooooo close soooo many times. Thanks be to God for not spilling the beans, man.
